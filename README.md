Online Discussion Forum Project (PHP + HTML)
The Online Discussion Forum is a web-based application designed to facilitate user interactions through topic-based discussions. The platform allows users to register, log in, post questions, reply to topics, and engage in threaded conversations, promoting community-based knowledge sharing.

Frontend (HTML/CSS):
The user interface is built using HTML for structure and CSS for styling. It provides users with intuitive pages like home, login/signup, post threads, and view/reply to discussions.

Backend (PHP & MySQL):
PHP handles server-side logic such as user authentication, post submission, thread listing, and comment management. MySQL is used to store user details, discussion threads, replies, and timestamps.

Key Features:

* User Registration & Login

* Create & View Discussion Topics

* Post & View Replies (Threaded Comments)

* Topic Categories (Optional)

* Basic Admin Control (e.g., delete topics or users)

Use Case:
Ideal for educational institutions, hobby groups, or customer support forums where users can interact, seek help, or share ideas.
